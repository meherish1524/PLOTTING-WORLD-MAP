## Overview
Pygal is a Python module that is mainly used to build SVG (Scalar Vector Graphics) graphs and charts. SVG is a vector-based graphics in the XML format that can be edited in any editor. Pygal can create graphs with minimal lines of code that can be easy to understand and write. 

We might want to plot the World Map with country wise boundaries and might even want to represent or differentiate countries on a geographical basis or based on some data in our project. Python Library “Pygal” will help us achieve our task. So let’s get started.

## Installation
```
pip install pygal_maps_world
```
Syntax:

```
worldmap =  pygal.maps.world.World()
Now you can plot the graph of the countries by using their country code. Here is the list of the country code.
